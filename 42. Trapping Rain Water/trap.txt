- Difficulty : Hard
- Topic : Two Pointer, Array, Stack, Dynamic Programming

- Intuition : 
    - count the amount of water can be TRAPPED 

- Approach : 
    - create TWO pointer to get the MAX-BAR in the left and right of array to calc the TRAP water
    - if `leftMax < rightMax` move the left forward, else move the right backward
    - calc the TRAP water between left and leftMax, and right and rightMax
    
- Complexity :
    - Time complexity  : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
