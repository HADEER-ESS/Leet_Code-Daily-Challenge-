Difficulty : Easy
Topic : Array, Sorting

Intuition : 
    - get the PAIRS with the MINIMUM different absolute.

Approach : 
    - sort the array.
    - get the **minimum different** between every two adjacent element.
    - get the **pair** with have the same **minimum difference**, and push in **res**.
    - return **res**

Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
