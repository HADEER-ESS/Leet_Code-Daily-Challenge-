- Difficulty : Hard
- Topic : Array, Greedy, Bit Manipulation, Tree

- Intuition : 
    - we need to XOR or TOGGLE the nodes in PAIR
    - the CNT must be EVEN number

- Approach : 
    - Loop through the **nums** array to maximize the XOR value as 
      we need to **sum** tha max value between (ORIGINAL and TOGGLE).
    - if the TOGGLE greater => sum it up, and increment the CNT
    - else => sum the original
    - MINIMIZE the difference between the TOGGLE and ORIGINAL

    - if the CNT is EVEN => return SUM
    - else => return SUM minus the MINIMIZE different `as we flip back the pair that has only one 
      NODE flipped with great number and another with low number`

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    -Space complexity : O(1)
