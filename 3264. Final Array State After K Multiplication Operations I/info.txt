- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Heap(Priority Queue), Simulation, Math

- Intuition : 
    - add items as **pair** || **object** {value, index}
    - sort them or add in a minimum **priority queue**.

- Approach : 
   - we can make a simulation in javascript to use Array instead of using CODED (Priority-Queue).

    - STEPS:
        - loop through **nums** to add items in **priority queue**
        - loop **k** times:
            - get the first (top) **smallest value** in queue
            - get its index and multiply its **value** in **nums**
            - update **priority queue** with the updated value with **same index**.

    - return **nums** again.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n^2)
    - Space complexity :  O(1)
