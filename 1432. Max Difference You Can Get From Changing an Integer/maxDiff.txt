- Intuition : 
    - get the differance between MAX and MIN numbers can be formed from `given number`.
    - MIN number must't leading zeros (not start with 0).

- Approach : 
    - convert the given number to **string**.
    - the MAX number must start with **9**
    - the MIN number must start with **1**

    - to get MIN number:
        - if number NOT START WITH **1** => `convert all digits match **nums[0]** to => **1**`
        - if number START WITH **1** => `convert any digit that not equal to **1** or **0** to => **0**

    - to get MAX number loop from 0,
        - 1- check if the DIGIT is **9** SKIP .
        - 2- if the DIGIT isn't **9** => `convert all DIGITS match it to => **9**`

    - return the differance.

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
