- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : String

- Intuition : 
    - reform the given string to make each sub-string with length K in UPPERCASE


- Approach : 
    - get the Length of given string without DASHES
    - create **ans** variable to store the new FORMED string
    - count number of sub-string can be formed with K length `cnt = len / k`
    - count the length of BEGING sub-string     `rest = len % k`
    
    - form the first section using `SUBSTRING` method from 0 to  **rest**
    - create WHILE loop to get every SECTION started with "-" dash
    - add eachtime a SubString from FORMED STRING, from **rest** to **rest+k**
    - increment the **rest** value by K each time and decremenet **cnt** value to reach the end

    - return **ans**

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity  : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
