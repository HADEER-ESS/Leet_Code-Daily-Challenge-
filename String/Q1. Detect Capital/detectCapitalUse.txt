- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : String

- Intuition : 
    - return TRUE if the given word is RIGHT


- Approach : 
    - Define TWO variables CNT `to count the CAPITAL character` and pos `to get the last position of CAPITAL character`
    - Loop thriugh the WORD and check if the CURRENT character is CAPITAL character
        - increment CNT
        - update POS to the CURRENT position

    - return TRUE in THREE conditions
        - #1 CNT equal to the LENGTH of given word => means ALL characters are CAPITAL
        - #2 CNT equal to 0                        => means NO character is CAPITAL
        - #3 CNT equal to 1 and POS equal to 0     => means there is ONE CAPITAL character at the BEGINNING of word
        
    - otherwise return FALSE

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity  : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
