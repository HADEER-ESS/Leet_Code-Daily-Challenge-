- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Dynamic Programming, Recursion

- Intuition : count all possible string can be created using vowels charachters
- Approach :
    - my first solution is to generate each string using alphabet and push it in result array, but that consume time and cause => run time error in high values like 50 when submite
    - the second solution is no reverse the string length counting using n by decrementing its value till reach 0 to increment res

- Complexity
    - Time complexity : O(n^4)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
