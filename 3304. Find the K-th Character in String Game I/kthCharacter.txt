- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Math, Bit Manipulation, Recursion, Simulation

- Intuition : 
    - loop through `same string` everytime, and update each character to the next, then append to **original** string.


- Approach : 
    - initialize your string with `word = "a"`
    - loop while the length os **word** is smaller than given **k**
    - each time, loop through **word** and level up each character, and store it in **curr** temporary string value
    - append the **curr** string to the end of **word**
    - REPEAT till, the length ow **word** exceed **k**

    - return the character in **word** at **k-1** index `word[k-1]`


- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(k)
    - Space complexity : O(k)
