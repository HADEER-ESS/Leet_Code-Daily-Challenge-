- Difficulty : Hard
- Topic : Array, Queue, Sliding Window, Monotomic Queue

- Intuition : 
    - loop through array to get the count of each subArray that match condition

- Approach : 
    - create **ans** variable to count
    - create nested loop outer for **l** and innter for **r**
        to get all possible subArray the match condition (min value >= minK)(max value <= maxK)
    - sub array may contain only **one number** when the **minK === maxK**
    - if we pass by anny number not match above contidion => **break** as it must be contiguous

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : 
        - First Solution => O(n^2)
    - Space complexity : 
        - First Solution =>  O(1)
