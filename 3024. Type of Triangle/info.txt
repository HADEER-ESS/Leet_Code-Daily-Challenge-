- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Math, Sorting

- Intuition : 
    - based on the triangle edge length return the triangle type.

- Approach : 
    - if all edges length equal => equilateral.

    - if there is 2 edges with same length, + the sum of any two edges **greater than** the third => isosceles.

    - if all edges aren't equal but the sum of any 2 edges greater than the third one => scalene.

    - else => none

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(1)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
