- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Enumeration

- Intuition : 
    - use Brute Force Looping to count number of subArray match the requirements

- Approach : 
    - create a nested Loop
    - first for **i**, second for **j**
    - check the first condition for |arr[i]-arr[j]|
    - third for **k**
    - check for the second and third coditions
    - if pass the condition => increment **ans** by one
    - return ans. 

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n^3)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
