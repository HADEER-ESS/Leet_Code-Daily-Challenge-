- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Hash Table, Counting

- Intuition : 
    - return the max number where its value and its frequency in array are the same or -1

- Approach : 
    - loop through the given array and count each number frequency using **map / hash table**
    - loop through **mp** and check of the [key, value] have same value,
    - assign a max value to **res**
    - return **res**

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
