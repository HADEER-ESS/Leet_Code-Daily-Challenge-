- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Greedy, Array, String

- Intuition : 
    - get the longest subsequance of array that no two adjacent elements are from the same group.

- Approach : 
    - create **ans** array to store the string every two adjacent elements are from different group.
    - loop through **groups** array and compare
        - the group of last item added to **ans** !== new income.
    - return **ans**

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
