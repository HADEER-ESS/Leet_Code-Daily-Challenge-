- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array

- Intuition : 
    - loop through array to count pair and find their index multiplication match condition.

- Approach : 
    - loop through array from beginning using i pointer and from end using j pointer.
    - check thc condition when the nums[i] equal to the nums[j] and when
        multiply the two idxs be divisable by k.
    - return the answer.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n^2)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
