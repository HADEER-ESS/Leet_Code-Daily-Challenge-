- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Math

- Intuition : 
    - loop to get the diffeances between the non-divisable **m** sum and divisable **m** sum

- Approach : 
    - loop from 1 to n
    - check each number if it is divisable by m or not
    - sum the number based on its divisable
    - return the diff between the **non-divisable** sum and **divisable sum**

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    -Space complexity : O(1)
