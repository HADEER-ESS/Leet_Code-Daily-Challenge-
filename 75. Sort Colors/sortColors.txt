- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Two Pointer, Sort, Array

- Intuition : 
    - sort the array inplace
    - there are THREE possible values
        - 0's to the left
        - 1's at the middle
        - 2's at the end

- Approach : 
    - create THREE pointers 
        - `left` for sorting and SWAPING 0's values
        - `right` for sorting and SWAPING 2's values
        - `idx` to iterate from 0 to the right. and check each value to SWAP it 
    
    - if `idx` value is 0 => SWAP it with left , and increment the left and idx values by one
    - if `idx` value is 2 => SWAP it with right, and decrement its value by one
        - recheck the new VALUE after SWAPPING if 0 => swap it with LEFT and increment BOTH
                                                  1 => increment idx value by one
    - if `idx` value is 1 => increment idx value by one

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity  : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
