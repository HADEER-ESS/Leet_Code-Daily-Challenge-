- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Array, Greedy, Sorting

- Intuition : 
    - Divide given **array** to 3-length sub arrays.
    - the differance between any two numbers in array must be SMALLER or EQUAL to **k**.

- Approach : 
    - sort the given array.
    - loop through array and increment by 3 everytime to check
        - if differance between any of ([i] , [i+1] , [i+2]) is GREATER THAN **k** => RETURN []
        - else push the sub-array to **res** array
    - RETURN **res**

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n log n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
