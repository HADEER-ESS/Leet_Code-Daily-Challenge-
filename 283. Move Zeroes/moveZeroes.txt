- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Two Pointer, Array

- Intuition : 
    - move zeros to the end of ARRAY without change the numbers order

- Approach : 
    - create TWO pointer `left` to search for zeros value and `right` to get the nearest non-zero value
    - loop through Array, when `nums[left] === 0`, search for the NEAREST `non-zero` value using RIGHT pointer
    - when find:
        - SWIPE
    - increment LEFT value by one
- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
