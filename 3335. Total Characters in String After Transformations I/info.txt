- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : String, Counting, Dynamic Programming, Math

- Intuition : 
    - get the formed string length.
    - each character transform to the next one except "z" it changs to "ab".
    - use ASCII for count and update the appearance for each character. 

- Approach : 
    - create **chars** array where count the appearance for each charcate in given string **s**.
    - loop **t** times to count each character transformation change.
    - create **visit** array to update characters count from **chars**, and update **chars** at the end.
    - if => **ch** reach **25** means it is **z** character, so
        - increment **a** at 0 &&
        - increment **b** at 1 by the count of **z**
    - else => increment the transformed character by the previous character count.

    - sum all **chars** array using **reduce** in *JS*, or **for loop** in *CPP*.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n + t)
    - Space complexity :  O(1)
