- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Hash Table, Math

- Intuition : 
    - count the max array than can form each number from 1  to n

- Approach : 
    - create **mp** as a container to count how many integers can form each number from 1 to n
    - FOR EXAMPLE => *1* can be formed by => [1 , 10] as **10** is 1 + 0 = 1
        => *2* can be formed by => [2 , 11] as **11** is 1+1 =2

    - loop from 1 to n to count how many number can be created, 
        and store the max **array** or **pairs** can be formed from each number.

    - loop through **mp** and compair to count the number of pairs that form 
        **max** number from one integer, and add to **ans**.

    - return **ans**

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n log n)
    - Space complexity : O(log n)
