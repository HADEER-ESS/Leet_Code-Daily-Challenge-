- Intuition : 
    - remove all starts from string, and one character with ASCII LOW LEVEL

- Approach : 
    - create array **idxs** consist of the **26-Alphabet character** to push position for each.
    - loop through **s** string
    - if current CHR not equal to STAR *, push its index in its index-position in **idxs**
    - if current CHR is STAR *, 
        - 1/ pop **one** index from **idxs** from array in the start (0 ~ 26), its SIZE greater than 0.
        - 2/ replace it to EMPTY STRING, **||** or mark its position as **removal**.
    
    - return the new string after apply the **removal** array **||** or JOIN.

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
