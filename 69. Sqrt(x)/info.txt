- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Math, Binary Search (B.S)

- Intuition : use binary search between 1 to x
- Approach :
    - use B.S start with 1 and end with x

    - calculate mid number by adding start with end and muliply with 2

    - check the following for update :
        - if mid * mid <= x  AND  mid+1 * mid+1 > x  =>  store the **mid** value.
        - if mid * mid > x      =>  decrement **end**  value.
        - else  =>      increment **start** value.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
