- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Recursion, Math

- Intuition : create calcPower function to get all possible number string with n string length
- Approach :
    - in javaScript i need to convert whole number to BigInt to
        can calculate and MOD them out.

    - in CPP I use long long data type to accept the huge numbers.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
