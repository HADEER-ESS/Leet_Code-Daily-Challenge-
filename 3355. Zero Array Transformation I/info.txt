- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Array, Prefix Sum

- Intuition : 
    - loop through array from start to end from **queries** array and decrement every item within the index by 1.
    - return if all numbers areequal to **||** lower than 0

- Approach : 
    - create **diff** array to store the possible differences for each index based on **queries** subset.
    - use **prefix-sum** instead of nested loop to sum the differences to add to num
    - return **true** when all numbers can reach 0

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
