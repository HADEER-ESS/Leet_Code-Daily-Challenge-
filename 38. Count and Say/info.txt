- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : String

- Intuition : 
    - loop through numbers from 2 to n.
    - Run Length Encoding => count + number, to genarate the new string number.

- Approach : 
    - init with length 1 with value of res => "1"
    - loop from 2 to n
    - get the last string to loop through its item and count
        the number based on run length encoding approuch, andadd to 
        res string;
    - return res

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n^2)
    - Space complexity : 
        - First Solution => O(n)
        - Second Solution => O(1)
