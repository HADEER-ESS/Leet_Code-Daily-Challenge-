- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Dynamic Programming

- Intuition : 
    - store the values of Pascal for every level and use it as a referance for every new one
- Approach :
    - get the PASCAL for basic numbers like 0, and 1 to take tham as a referance.
    - loop from **2** to the target **rowIndex**.
    - each time to create a new **array** start and end it by **1**.
    - to get the in between values, sub every TWO PAIRS of previous one as `last[j]+last[j+1]` equation.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
