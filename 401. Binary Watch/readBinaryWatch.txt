- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, BackTracking, Recursion

- Intuition : 
    - from given available HOURS and MINUTES get the time when number of LED is ON

- Approach : 
    - create an array for HOURS   = [1, 2, 4, 8]            //len = 4
    - create an array for MINUTES = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]    //len = 6
    - create an ANS array
    - use a Handler Recursion Function passed the TOTAL-LED, that be decremented each time signing to USED-LED

    - `createTime(turnedOn, idx, hour, minute)`
    - check at the beginning of function if hours reach `11` or if minuest reach `59`
    - check if the turnedOn reach `0` so we formed a TIME with avaialble LED count, and push to ANS
    - otherwise Loop starting from IDX till `10` which the Total Length of BOTH array 

    - if current idx `i` is LESS than 4 => so we can take from HOURS first
    - else => take from MINUTES
    - recall the helperFunction with new values `createTime(turnedOn-1, i+1, currHr, currMin)`

    - return ANS

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(1)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
