- Difficulty : Hard
- Topic : Array, Greedy

- Intuition : 
    - cover the range from 1 to **n**
    - we can use given number from array **nums** or patch new numbers to cover the RANGE

- Approach : 
    -  start the **miss** value by 1 (as it is the minimum value can be cover)
    - make comparison while **miss** is SMALLER or EQUAL to given **n**
    - if `miss > nums[idx]` so => the given number in **nums** cover the range
        - increment idx
        - update miss value by adding the LAST NUMS to it, to check the LARGEST cover number
    - else => there is the MISSING number need to be patch,
        - increment PATCH value
        - update miss to update the range of number can be covered when adding MISS value to nums, by doubling it `miss *= 2` 

    - return PATCH

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
