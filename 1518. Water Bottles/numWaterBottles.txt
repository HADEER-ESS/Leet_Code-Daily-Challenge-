- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Math, Simulation

- Intuition : 
    - continue measure the number of possible bottles tell the TOTAL become LESS THAN exchange number

- Approach : 
    - make the init VALUE equale to number of bottles

    - measure till the bottles become un-EXCHANGABLE

    - increment the ANS by the NUMBER of BOTTLE can be exchange from total by `total / exchange`

    - change the number of TOTAL by the new exchangable bottles, and the REMAIN BOTTLES from EVERY EXCHANGE.

    return ans.

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
