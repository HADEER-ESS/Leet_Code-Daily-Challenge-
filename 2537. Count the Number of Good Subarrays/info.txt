- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Array, Hash Table, Sliding window

- Intuition : 
    - loop through array to count sub-array with at least k pairs

- Approach : 
    - create sliding window with r pointer move formard
    - mp to count each number appearcne to get the pair count
    - l left pointer start with 0 to get all possible sub arraies, 
        and decrement pairs count wile move foreword.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
