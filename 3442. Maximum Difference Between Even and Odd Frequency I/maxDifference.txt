- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Hash Table, String, Counting

- Intuition : 
    - get the max differance between Odd and Even alphabets count.

- Approach : 
    - count the appearcne for every Alphabet.
    - loop to get the `MAX ODD` and `MIN EVEN` count.
    - return the differance.

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
