- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Two Pointer, Sort, Array, Binary Search, Greedy

- Intuition : 
    - sort the array
    - to create Triangle, the sum of TWO edges must be GREATER than the third one
    - fix one iteration to get the TRIPLE

- Approach : 
    - fix **i** iteration `from length-1 to 2`
    - create TWO POINTER for each end of the SubArray
    - REPEATE:
        - if the sum of values in LEFT and RIGHT > the THIRD edges
            => the all edges' value between those TWO POINTER are valid `ANS += (right - left)
            => decrement the GREAT pointer by one `right--`
        - else :
            => increment the SMALL pointer by one `left++`
    
    - return the ANS value

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n^2)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
