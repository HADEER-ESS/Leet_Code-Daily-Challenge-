- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : String Matching, Sub-string, Repeat

- Intuition : 
    - Check if the Given String have a repeated Sub-String or not

- Approach : 
    - get the MID of the string
    - loop through string from `1->mid`
    - get the Sub-String each time FROM 0 TO i
    - CALCULATE the assumed REPEATED time for the Sub-String by `String Length / Sub-String Length` = X
    - check if the X repeated time for Sub-String form the given Sting
        - YES       =>      return TRUE

    - return FALSE

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity  : O(n^2)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
