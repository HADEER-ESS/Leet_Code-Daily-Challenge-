- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Stack, Array

- Intuition : 
    - calculate the time each calculation with unique ID take


- Approach : 
    - create stack STK to push ID for every START TIME for calculation.
    - create array ANS array to store the time consumption for each.
    - loop through given LOGS
        - if the operation name is START => push id in STK, update LAST TIME, calculate TAKEN time (curr - prev) `if not the first calculation`
        - if the operation name is END   => pop id from STK, update LAST TIME, calculate TAKEN time (curr - prev + 1)

    - return ANS

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity  : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
