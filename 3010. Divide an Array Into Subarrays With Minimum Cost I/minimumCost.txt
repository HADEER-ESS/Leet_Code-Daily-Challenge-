- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Greedy, Sorting

- Intuition : 
    - get the minimum COST for THREE subarray formed from given array

- Approach : 
    - always take the first INTEGER of array as the FIRST formed sub-array
    - sort the rest of array ascendingly, to get the LOWEST cost for sub-array can be formed
    - `sub = nums.slice(1)`
    - `sub.sort()`
    - take the first TWO items from SUB sorted array
    - return SUM `nums[0] + sub[0] + sub[1]`


- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n log n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
