- Intuition : 
    -get th minimum sum of every possible triangle's weight can be form in the given polygon.

- Approach : 
    - create 2D array to store the weigh of each triangle with (i,j,k) vertex staring value 0.

    - loop from SIZE 3 (each triangle must contain only 3 vertex)

    - the start point i is 0 and end with LENGTH-size to prevent j (end vertex) to be out of scope.

    - calculate J

    - loop with k to be in the MIDDLE between i and j point

    - calculate the SUM of all possible TRIANGLES

    - store the MIN value.

    - return the MIN value.

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n^3)
    - Space complexity : O(n^2)
