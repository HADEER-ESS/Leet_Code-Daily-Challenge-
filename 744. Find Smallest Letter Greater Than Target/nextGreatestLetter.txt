- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Binary Search, 

- Intuition : 
    - get the SMALLEST character that GREATER than target

- Approach : 
    - create LEFT and RIGHT pointers point to each side of Array
    - loop through array while `LEFT <= RIGHT`
    - calculate the MID pointer
    - check if CURRENT mid character `lettrs[mid]` is GREATER than target
        => update ANS, and move the LEFT pointer to the right `right = mid - 1` 
    - else  
        => move the RIGHT pointer to the left `left = mid + 1`
    
    - return ANS

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
