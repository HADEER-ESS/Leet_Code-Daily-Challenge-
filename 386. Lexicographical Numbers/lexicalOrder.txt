- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Depth-First Search(DFS), Trie

- Intuition : 
    - get all possible numbers from 1 to given **n**

- Approach : 
    - use DFS to get every number from 1 to 9 is like a ROOT and append to
        another numbers from 1 to 9 also every level like a TREE
    - create **res** array to store numbers in Lexicographical way
    - start from 1 to 9 while **created number** is lower than **n**

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
