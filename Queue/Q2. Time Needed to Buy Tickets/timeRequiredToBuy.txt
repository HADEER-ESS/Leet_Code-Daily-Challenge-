- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Queue, Count, Simpulation

- Intuition : 
    - count number of seconds take to make person at index K to buy all the tickets he needs
    - can buy a ticket every time, then go to the end of QUEUE
    - buy ticket take 1 second


- Approach : 
    - create CNT variavle that count number of SEC need to make kth person buy his ticket
    - loop through Array
    - if the i <= k     }=> add the MIN between the current i's person and k's person ticket
    - else              }=> add the MIN between the current i's person and k's person ticket -1 (as i locate after k, so k will be finish first)

    - return CNT

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity  : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
