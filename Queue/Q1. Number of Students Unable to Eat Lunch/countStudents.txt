- Intuition : 
    - count number of students, who unable to but their favorite sandwiches.


- Approach : 
    - create UNABLE variable to count the number of student can't buy sandwiches
    - loop through array UNTIL the STUDENT array becomes empty
    - if item in STUDENT array and SANDWICHES array have same if => ERASE
    - else => ERASE from start and PUSH at end, till UNABLE value match the CURRENT student length.

    - return UNABLE

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity  : O(n^2)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
