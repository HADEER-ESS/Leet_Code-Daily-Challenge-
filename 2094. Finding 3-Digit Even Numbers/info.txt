- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Sorting, Hash Table, Enumeration 

- Intuition : 
    - sort and get the max possible number can be form from digits

- Approach : 
    - count the appearance for each digit (1-9) in array.
    - loop through min three-digit number (100) to the max three-digit number (999) or **get the maximum number can be form from the given digits**.

    - divide the formed number into 
        - hundreds  => three
        - tens  => two
        - ones  => one
    - create a flag **success** to make sure the count of each digit appearane are equal.
    - minus the **cnt** of each digit formed number and check if it become lower **zero** => change flag **success** to false.
    - if flag remains true => push formed number in **ans** array.
    - reset the **cnt** of digits as was.

    - return **ans**.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
