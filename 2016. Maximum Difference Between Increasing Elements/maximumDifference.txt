- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array

- Intuition : 
    - get the MAXIMUM difference between TWO numbers

- Approach :
    - start with MIN value at position **0** in Array
    - loop from **1** to the end of Array with **i**
    - if the `nums[i] > MIN` => CALCULATE diff and store in **res**
    - update the MIN value while iterating.

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : 
        - solution #1 => O(n^2)
        - solution #2 => O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
