- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : String, Hash Table, Counting

- Intuition : 
    - get each character frequency
    - separate between Vowels and Consonant
    - get MAX freq
    - sum and return

- Approach : 
    - loop through string s
    - get each character index in stored array count
    - check if the Character is VOWEL => get the max count
    - else => get the max count using MAX method
    - return the sum between them

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
