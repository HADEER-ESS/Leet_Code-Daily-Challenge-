- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Array, Greedy, Sorting

- Intuition : 
    - Count the sub-seqance arrays, the diff between MAX and MIN elements is `<= k`

- Approach : 
    - work GREEDY by sorting the array
    - store min for nums[0]
    - loop through the array, from 1 -> n
        - if the diff between comeing numbers nums[i] and min <=k => CONTINUE;
        - => UPDATE min, and increment count cnt by 1
    - return cnt
    

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
