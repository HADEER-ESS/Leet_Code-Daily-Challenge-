- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Two Pointer, Sort, Array, Binary Search

- Intuition : 
    - given a SORTED array
    - get the position of integers which their SUM equal to TARGET

- Approach : 
    - create TWO pointer in each end of the array (left, right)
    - loop through the array WHILE left !== right
    - if the SUM of two numbers are equal to TARGET => return their POSITIONS
    - if the SUM < TARGET => **we need to INCREMENT the sum** => move the RIGHT pointer
    - if the SUM > TARGET => **we need to DECREMENT the sum** => move the LEFT pointer

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
