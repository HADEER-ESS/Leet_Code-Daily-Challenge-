- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Recursion, Math

- Intuition : 
    - get the result of pass a custome power and a custome number.
    - Pwer and Number both maybe to be NEGATIVE.

- Approach : 
    - use recusrion to calculate the power of number 

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
