- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Linked List

- Intuition : 
    - delete doublicated node value from given list


- Approach : 
    - loop through the given list
    - check if the CURRENT node value EQUAL to the NEXT NODE value  `list.val === list.next.val` 
        - SKIP the NEXT NODE, but link the CURRENT node to the NEXT-> NEXT node `list.next = list.next.next`

    - else => make it Link normally to the NEXT node `list = list.next`

    - return the HEAD.

    - Time complexity  : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
