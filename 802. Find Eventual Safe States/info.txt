- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Topological Sort, Deapth First Search, Breadth First Search, Graph

- Intuition : 
    - get th SAFE NODE from graph unidirected node.

- Approach :
    - create a VISIT array :
        - 0 => means not visit.
        - 1 => means visit.
        - 2 => means safe node => and push it in answer **ans** array.
    
    - use DFS to traverse over graph's nodes

- Complexity
    - Time complexity : O(n + e)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
