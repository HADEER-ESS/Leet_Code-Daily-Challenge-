- Intuition : 
    - get the `differance between` MAX number and MIN number can be formed from given number using 0 ~ 9

- Approach : 
    - convert the given number to **string**.
    - the MAX number must start with **9**
    - the MIN number must start with **0**

    - to get MIN number loop from 1 and convert any number match **num[0]** value convert it to **0** and `concate it to **small** variable`
    - to get MAX number loop from 0,
        - 1- check if the DIGIT is **9** SKIP `concate it to **large** variable`.
        - 2- if **target** is EMPTY => store the CURRENT DIGIT, and `concate *9* to **large** variable`
        - 3- if DIGIT equal to **target** => `concate *9* to **large** variable`
        - 4- else `concate DIGIT to **large** variable`

    -FOR EXAMPLE

        - num = 785
            - large = 985
            - small = 085
        - ans = 985 - 085 => 900

        - num = 90
            - large = 99
            - small = 00
        - ans = 99 - 00 => 99
