- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Math, Simulation

- Intuition : 
    - get the MAXIMUM number of bottle can be exchange
    - after every exchange operation, will increment EXCHANGE number by one 

- Approach : 
    - start the ANS to be equal to NUM 
    - do the equation till `NUM < EXCHANGE`
    - decrement the num of EXCHANGE every Time
    - increment NUM by one (as the exchanged one will be empty then)
    - increment EXCHANGE
    - increment ANS

    - return ANS

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
