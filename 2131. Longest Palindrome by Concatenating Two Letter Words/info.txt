- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Array, Hash Table, Greedy, String, Counting

- Intuition : 
    - get the longest palindrom string using given array from string

- Approach : 
    - count every string appearance.

    - loop through **words**.

    - if the WORD and its REV is same like "aa" check:=>
        - if its count only **one** => place it in the middle of **future 
          palindrom string**.
        - else => increment the **count** of string by **4**.

    - if the **count** of WORD and REV is greater than **0** placed them in 
      **future string** in decrement the **word** count.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n log n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
