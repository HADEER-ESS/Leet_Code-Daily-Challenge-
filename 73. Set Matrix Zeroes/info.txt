- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Array, Hash Table, Matrix

- Intuition : 
    - loop through array and get the posistion of cell with value **0** and 
      set its row and column cells to **zero**.

- Approach : 
    - loop thtorugh matrix and store the position of zero cell in **zeros** array **[r,c]**

    - traverse through stored **positions** and change every cell share with same **row** or 
      **column** to zero.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n * m)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
