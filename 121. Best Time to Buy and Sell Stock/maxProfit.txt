- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Dynamic Programming

- Intuition : 
    - get the MAX profit.
    - need to BUY the product with MIN value
    - need to SELL the product with MAX value
- Approach :
    - store the MIN price while traversing, starting from 0 in price and traverse from 1
    - using Dynamic Programming to store max profit.
    - while TRAVERSING : 
        - get the min price value.
        - update in **dp** => check if the PREVIOUS profit is greater than the CURRUNT profit (prices[i]-min)
        - return the last value in **dp** 

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
