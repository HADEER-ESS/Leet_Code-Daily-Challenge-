- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : String, Stack, Greedy

- Intuition : 
    - make the string Start with "A" then "B"

- Approach : 
    - create a `b_cnt` variable to count the number of "B" before or within "A" exist
    - loop through the given string
    - if the character equal to B => increment the `b_cnt`
    - if the character equal to A => check the COUNT of `b_cnt` if it GREATER than 0
        - increment ANS (as we will remove it)
        - decrement the `b_cnt` value
    - return ANS

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
