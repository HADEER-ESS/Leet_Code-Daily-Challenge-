- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Two Pointer, Greedy, Array

- Intuition : 
    - calculate the MAX area can beformed from the given HEIGHT
    - AREA = width * height
    - width =  th different between TWO point (left and right)
    - height = the minimum height among TWO GIVIN points

- Approach : 
    - create TWO pointer left and right for the ARRAY
    - apply the AREA equation while `left != right`
    - CALCULATE the area between every TWO given points
    - check if the LEFT height is SMALL => move it forward
    - else => move the RIGHT pointer forward

    - return area

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
