- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Two Pointer, Sort, Array, Binary Search

- Intuition : 
    - sort the array
    - fix one iteration to get the TRIPLE

- Approach : 
    - fix **i** iteration `from 0 to length -1`
    - SKIP the doublication from the outer iterations **i** by checking the new number EQUAL to the previous one => SKIP
    - create the TWO Pointer
    - iterate inside the POINTER range
        - calculate the SUM
        - if SUM > 0 => positive number is large => `right--` move backward
        - if SUM < 0 => negative number is small => `left++` move forward
        - else => push the TRIPLE to ANS
            - SKIP the doublication for LEFT and RIGHT pointers

    - retusn ANS

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n^2)
    - Space complexity : O(n^2)
