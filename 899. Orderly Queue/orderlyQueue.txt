- Difficulty : Hard
- Topic : Math, String, Sort

- Intuition : 
    - return the smllest lexicographically string
    - lexicographically string: the small ASCII character value exist at the beginning of string

- Approach : 
    -  TWO options to consider
        - 1. k = 1, we can only rotate the string, so we need to find the lexicographically smallest rotation
        - 2. k > 1, we can sort the string, so we just return the sorted string
    
    - K == 1:
        - store th current string
        - check for all posibilities by loop
        - move the first character to the end of string
        - compare to check the new REV string and STORE string
        - reassign to the SMALLEST one

        - return STORE

    - K > 1
        - sort the string
        - return the sorted string.


- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n^2)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
