- Topic : Array, Hash Table, Math, Greedy

- Intuition : 
    - Greedy count the rabbit in forest, using Map and Math to get number of groups

- Approach : 
    - count each number appearance in array, and store in array mp.

    - loop through mp to count Rabbits in forest

    - if the count mod the expected count i+1 equals ZERO 
        => means all rabbit with same color answer in the array 
        => add their cnt in ans

    - lse => means not all rabbits with same color answers and 
      there is more in the forest =>
        1- count the number of groups they form cnt
        2- multiply with the expected number i+1
        3- add them to ans
    -return ans

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
