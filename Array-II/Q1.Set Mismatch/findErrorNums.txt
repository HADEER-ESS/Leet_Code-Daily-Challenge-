- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Sorting, Hash Table

- Intuition : 
    - get the DOUBLICATED and the MISSED item from array

- Approach : 
    - sort the given array
    - get the length of array
    - will iterate from 1 => length
    - get the Doublicated item from array where `nums[i] === num[i+1]`
    - get the Missed item from array by CHECKING the existance of each from `1 => LEN`

    - return the TWO integers

- Complexity :
    - Time complexity : O(n log n)
    - Space complexity : O(1)
