- Difficulty : Medium
- Topic : Array, Hash Table, Prefix Sum

- Intuition : 
    - loop through array to get the output calc (ONE || ZERO) 
        base on condition using PREFIX SUM.

- Approach : 
    - create a memorization **mp** to store each number **prefix**, 
        and store each **sum** is satisfied to condition of **sum** with 
        modularity is equal to **k**.

    - each time we pass by this **prefix** we add its value to **ans**.

    -return **ans**.

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
