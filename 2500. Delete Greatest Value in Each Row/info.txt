- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Heap(Priority Queue), Sorting, Simulation, Matrix

- Intuition : 
    - eliminate the maximum item from every row, each time.
    - add the max number among them to the **ans**.

- Approach : 
   - sort every row in **grid**
    - loop until the *column** count be zero `"as the column decreased ecery time"`
    - store the **maximum** value from rows, and **pop** in from the *row*
    - add the maximum value to **ans**
    - return **ans**

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n*m log n)
    - Space complexity :  O(1)
