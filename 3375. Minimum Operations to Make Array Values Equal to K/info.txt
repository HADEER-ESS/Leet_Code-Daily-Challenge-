- Difficulty : Easy
- Topic : Array, Hash-Table, Storing

- Intuition : count the distinct integer which greater that k
- Approach :
    - get the min => to check the impossible condition
    - get the max => to create array with length max+1 or 101
    - count the distinct integer which greater that k
    - return ans

- Complexity :
    -Time complexity : O(n)
    - Space complexity : O(n)
